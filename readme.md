## TL;DR

> There is a big hype about front-end frameworks all over the place. But what if we could build components without the need to reach out for big players like React,Vue and Angular?
>
> Turns out, this is a totally possible thing to do and it is quite easy using [StencilJs](https://stenciljs.com/docs/getting-started)
>
> Not only that we can build components which we can use in vanilla HTML, JS and CSS projects, but also creating components
> which we can also reuse with frameworks like React, Vue and Angular.
>
> So the goal of this project is to exactly showcase that

## Where can I find the deployed version? 🤔

This project hosts a deployed version right here on Github.

On each merge into the main branch, the awesome Github Action [github-pages-deploy-action](https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action) takes care of deploying the static files to the gh-pages branch.

## Goal 🏁

The goal of this project is to showcase what we can do with web components and eventually to create a component library that we can host on npm.

## Who we are?

Our project team contains members from the [zero-to-mastery](https://zerotomastery.io) community.
